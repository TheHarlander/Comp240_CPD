## Weekly Reports

Introduction
After receiving my grades from last semester I was very pleased with the results after expecting to get low I managed to get two 2:1s and a 2:2. This has gave me a bit of motivation booster as now I feel like I can actually get a 2:1 overall, my main goal for this year is to improve my skill in programming as I still feel like I am very week at this.


#### Week 1
Our changed timetable was quite nice, having all lectures on 2 days then the rest of the week is independent work. I was looking forward to getting ahead by starting on my research journals but me and my partner have come down with this severe throat bug. Unable to get out of bed and keep a clear thought I was stuck in bed for the majority of the week. Being in bed I was able to think of a skill I should implement straight away after I get better, this skill is a timetable for the week. Because I have more free time now it is vital that I structure this with efficiency if I want to succeed this year.

#### Week 2
My illness did not relent early this week so i missed monday and tuesday lectures, I looked at the slides but there was not much to look at. After doing some essential reading (which i did not understand much i then worked on my AI research paper, I managed to do 150 words. Friday the group came into uni to work on the java server work with not much luck. My improvement of this week would be to come into university a day or 2 extra as it is nice to get out of the house into a different workstation.
#### Week 3
I have been doing a lot of the network security essay this week, focusing on bot nets and worms as these are network driven malicious programs. Although i’ve done 500 words i feel like i need to spend a bit more time on it even if it's 30 minutes more my productivity would go up. Finding a place in town which has wifi would be good as then i can change up my workplace to see if it helps me work for longer.

#### Week 4
This week I have been trying to focus on the java concurrency and trying to comprehend and finish the 100 pages assigned to us. I had trouble making time to work in the group because when i was free they were not and wh3en they were i was not aswell, organising a set day where we could have a pure study day would be very beneficial for all of us.

#### Week 5
Monday was the last day we could work on the java concurrency task, tom, maddie and I worked on the break timer. Tom and I did not programme it to be concurrent so we had to change it to take the tick timer class instead of a local timer. We have also now decided to improve it further by turning the game state into an ENUM instead of the way we had it so depending on the main state we can just switch. I’ve also spent the day finishing one of my essays so I’m feeling happy about that.



#### Week 6
This week I focused on research journals and finding references for them. The security one was nice and interesting but with the AI reading about deepmind felt like it dragged on and was tedious to read about. I was able to easily find reference this time which made the security journal easy, but with the AI i was stuck on Deepmind and did not know what to search for. For this weeks improvement I want to expand my resources by taking out book in the library to read, this would give me a wider range of references and knowledge on the subject.

#### Week 7 
I’ve had to completely restart my AI project as I could not seem to get the ai for the cat game to work, the VR in the game is not making sense and I can not even get a simple move to player character to work. After restarting I was able to get further within 10, this is a  relief as i do not have very long to create something. As i have not worked much in unreal i found it very difficult to do and therefore also procrastinate working in it more, but now i have been working in it i'm starting to get the hang of it and it's making me want to work in it more. My improvement of the week is to work on these types of projects a little each week so then i'm learning more, this has been a major factor in my work ethic being and i'm set on making this better.

#### Week 8
After the AI project was handed in I thought for some reason that it’d be nice to try and resolve the cat issue with a lot of time to spare but it turned out to be as confusing as last week. I turned to my classmates for help but they did not have a clue and so I asked milly which he thought it’d be easy but found it to be a tough challenge to cross. I feel as if an improvement I could make for this week is the access to my peers, although I had not gotten any further from asking them, getting a form of comradery with them would make me not take as long to ask them in the future.

#### Week 9
This was a slow week as not much was achieved still being stuck on getting the cats working, it doesn't recognise the vr as a player and so does not go after anything. We decided to remake the game and try again but it still did not work. We finally managed to get it working by putting the get all classes and actors in the level blueprint and making it follow the newVrpawn. I think finding a good unreal blueprints book or online source would greatly improve my work as it allows me to get a more indepth look at blueprints.


#### Week 10
I thought as its my birthday this week i’d go home on the weekend to see my mum, I then found out after i got home that they were meeting up on monday to do work on the client server project. I was unable to get back as the busses are awkward going back home and now I’m worried about what i'm going to do for it. I find myself being able to read hardback books better than pdfs online because my eyes lose focus on the bright white pages on screen. For this weeks improvement I would like to take out or buy the reading material so then it is easier to read.


#### Week 11
Focusing on power ups this week I was able to make the enlarge powerup and speed up power up, both having challenges in the selves I was able to overcome them with dedication also learned a few things along the way. The game is starting to take shape although some things did not go as planned I think we’ve done alright considering how much we’ve grown to hate working in VR. My improvement for the week is to never work in VR again.

#### Week 12
It’s a rush to get everything done and it’s always very stressful at these times. I have managed to keep a cooler head more than normal which I find is an achievement in itself. This week I focused on my java client server, at the start of the week I had no clue as to what I was expected to do but after search after search I was able to find a guide online that talked about making an online MUD.  it all started to make a little more sense than before, i would have to create a client server chat then turn that into a mud is what it pretty much said. Finding a tutorial on a basic chat on java wasn't that difficult and after completing it i had a very basic understanding on what i was looking for and then I was able to find another tutorial on how to actually implement it into a start of a game. Actually making this game would be another challenge but due to my time management i was unable to get any further. My improvement for the week is to when i get the assignment is to make a foundation/plan of action on how to do the task, finding resources would definitely make working through the months easier.
